                <p class="text1">A one-year field test in South Africa revealed that using a solar stove, 
                    an average family can save 30 litres of kerosene, 30 kg of LPG and about 1 tonne of 
                    firewood per year, which comes to an estimated 1 tonne of carbon dioxide reduction annually.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text1">This startling statistic, when combined with the fact that we receive 10-15,000
                    times more solar energy on the Earth than we use, opens up amazing possibilities for the use
                     of the sun's energy to meet out needs.
                   Today, fuel wood accounts for almost a fifth of the world's primary energy consumption.
                    Each year about 2 billion tonnes of wood are burnt mainly for cooking purposes. Yet, 
                    today, we are facing a crisis with our fast diminishing forest cover and a fuel wood 
                    shortage for more than 2 billion people around the world.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text1">Apart from the obvious advantages of time and money saved, solar cooking
                    produces no smoke, and thus no pollution. It does not release greenhouse gases like 
                    burning of other types of fuel does.

                   It cooks healthy food with minimal oil. It eliminates risks like fire and burns. 
                   Best of all, it uses a renewable energy source that can be freely harnessed by almost
                    anyone using basic equipment.
                   
                   It also has the potential to create a new industry with jobs for local communities.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text1">Paint the inside of one of the Styrofoam cups with black poster paint.
                    This will be the cooking chamber, and the black paint will absorb sunlight and cause
                     it to warm up. Add the food to the bottom of the cup. Chop it into small pieces. 
                     Vegetables and fruit work best. Don't attempt to cook meat in the solar cooker.

                   Cover the cup with cling wrap, and pull it tight; hold it in place with an elastic 
                   band around the rim of the cup.
                   
                   Use the aluminium foil to collect sunlight. In order to stiffen it, tape or glue it 
                   to a piece of construction paper. Make sure the shiny side is up, and try to avoid getting 
                   any wrinkles in it. Then wrap it around your cup, so that the foil faces inwards, and fasten 
                   with tape. Trim the top edge.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text1">Put this inside a second cup, to hold the tube securely in place,
                    and to provide a little more insulation for your oven.

                   Now put your 'oven' into an insulator-you could use a Styrofoam chunk with a 
                   hole cut out the size of the cup or a box filled with dirt. The idea is to use 
                   something that will keep the heat in. You could also bury it in the ground if the weather 
                   is not cold. Make sure the collector foil is unwrinkled and pointing at the sun.
