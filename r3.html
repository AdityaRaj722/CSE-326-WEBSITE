                <p class="text1">A habitat is the natural environment in which plants and animals live. 
                    This is where they get their food, water and shelter. They also breed in their natural 
                    habitat. The climate of a habitat, the food available in the habitat, competition 
                    from other species- these are some of the factors that determine whether 
                    a species will survive or not.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text1"><h4 class="text1">Why we study habitat ?</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li class="text1">Studying a habitat gives us information about the different life forms that live in it.</li>
                      <li class="text1">It helps us identify what are the factors that can lead to changes in the habitat and<br> differentiate between man-made and natural factors.</li>
                      <li class="text1">It helps understand the impact of human actions on other life forms.</li>
                      <li class="text1">It helps us understand how different animals and plants adapt to changes in their habitat</li>
                    </ul>  </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text1">Added to this is the human factor- buildings, roads, traffic noise, pollution from waste 
                    and industries, cutting down of trees. Many species have a mechanism of survival. 
                    Their body might make some modifications, or they may start having a different kind 
                    of food is their natural food is not available, or they may move to other places in 
                    search of food. We call these changes adaptation.</p>

                   <p class="text1"> Take an area in your neighbourhood and identify the habitat of that area- what 
                    kind of trees, shrubs and water bodies are there. Make a model of the habitat. 
                    Identify which elements of the habitat is natural and which is introduced by man, 
                    for example, new trees not originally found in that area, or an artificial lake, 
                    or animals introduced into the area.</p>
