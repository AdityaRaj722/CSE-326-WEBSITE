                <p class="text1">Every year each household contributes waste products by using and consuming 
                    disposable products and materials. Sometimes these things are recycled, like many paper, 
                    plastic and glass products. Other times the items are re-used, like old tires that are 
                    chipped and used to build playground surfacing materials. Some people even save kitchen 
                    scraps to add to a compost pile in their yard.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text1">Everything else ends up in a landfill, the place where the garbage man takes 
                    all of your trash. Landfills are huge piles of trash that are often buried to help the waste 
                    products break down, or decompose. Products that decompose rapidly are called "biodegradable 
                    materials." These products are good for the environment because they will break down in 
                    the landfill and will not leach harmful chemicals into the soil.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text1">In addition to being biodegradable, many materials are compostable. Kitchen waste, 
                    paper products, and wood products are examples of things that can be used in a compost pile to 
                    make fertile, nutrient rich soil. Do an experiment composting different materials. Compare and 
                    contrast different methods of composting: open vs. closed, covered or uncovered, with or without 
                    turning, with or without watering. You can also experiment with vermiculture, or worm composting.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text1">Sometimes products that are biodegradable will say so on the package. This way a 
                    consumer can make an informed choice about which types of products to buy. In this experiment, 
                    you can conduct your own survey of selected materials to investigate if they are biodegradable 
                    or not in the soil.</p>
