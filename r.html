                <p class="text1">Greywater is wastewater from any household source other than toilets.
                     Greywater makes up roughly 60% of household wastewater. A greywater recycling system
                      uses water primarily from showers and bathtubs. It can also capture water from
                       bathroom or wastewater from the utility sink and washing machine..</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text1"><h4 class="text1">Some advantages of recycling greywater</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li class="text1" >Useful during periods of droughts or water shortage.</li>
                      <li class="text1">Saves on your water bills.</li>
                      <li class="text1">No wastage of water.</li>
                      <li class="text1">Helps save useful plants and vegetables when the water supply is very low.</li>
                      <li class="text1">Can be used for collecting and using rainwater.</li>
                    </ul>  
                    </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text1">The simplest and cheapest greywater recycling system is to capture shower
                     and bath water in a bucket and use it to flush a toilet. But take care never to fill
                      the flush storage tank with greywater as it will start smelling and may clog the 
                      flushing mechanism. Another simple way is to collect the water from a washing machine
                       in a tub by connecting the outlet to the tub, and using this water for the garden.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text1">You will need a filter to collect any waste materials, 2 big buckets, 
                    drainage pipes, valves to control the flow of the water, a surge tank and a lever 
                    to control from which source the water is coming. You will also need a small garden in a
                     wooden box. Make sure the plants you select are not vegetables or fruit plants. For the model 
                     you need not use a pump. Just make sure the source of greywater is higher than the drainpipes. 
                     Attach the filter or home made sieve to the top of one bucket.
                    </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text1">Pour clean water in one bucket and greywater in the bucket with the sieve.
                     Both buckets must be connected to the drainage system. But when water from one bucket 
                     flows through it the other must close. The valves will do this. When the bucket with 
                     greywater is full, open the valve to let the water flow through the drainpipe. Make sure the 
                     water does not collect at one place as it will then be a breeding ground for mosquitoes 
                     and also cause flooding. It should flow steadily on to the soil in the small garden.
