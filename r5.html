                <p class="text1">Organic gardening is the use of natural compost and manure to fertilise 
                    and grow plants and flowers. No harmful chemicals or pesticides are used to protect the plants.
                     As opposed to gardening that uses pesticides and other chemicals, organic gardening is truly natural.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text1">Organic gardening is one of the many ways in which we can get our share from the earth as 
                    well as preserve it for future generations. Not only is it safe, but it also does not harm the soil, 
                    the habitat or the environment.
